<p>Ammonites were ancient marine animals that lived in the oceans millions of years ago, long before dinosaurs went extinct. 
They are best known for their beautifully coiled shells, which grew in chambers as the animal matured. These creatures belonged to a group of cephalopods, 
making them distant relatives of modern squids and octopuses. Ammonites were incredibly diverse, with thousands of species that varied in size, shape, and shell patterns. 
They thrived in Earth’s seas for over 300 million years before disappearing during the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous period. Today, ammonite fossils are commonly 
found around the world and are important to scientists because they help date rock layers. Their intricate shells also make them popular among fossil collectors and museum exhibits.</p>
